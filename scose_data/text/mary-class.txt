AMY|okay . okay on?
AMY|all right.
AMY|bye bye.
AMY|okay.
AMY|so . with this stupid class.
AMY|it is not fair.
MAR|so what gets moved to ten?
MAR|I don't get it.
AMY|okay.
AMY|if we take.
AMY|you understand the fact that they're kicking us out of this ten o'clock section.
MAR|right, but what are they moving to ten?
AMY|wait.
AMY|so the class is at one o'clock.
AMY|if they move ⁎our⁎ math class to ten.
AMY|which would be ten to twelve.
AMY|we would have an hour for lunch?
MAR|which one's the math class?
AMY|the one the math class.
MAR|eight o'clock?
AMY|eight o'clock.
AMY|yeah.
MAR|that's what it is.
AMY|sorry.
AMY|if we move that eight o'clock to . ten then we don't have an hour break.
AMY|which would be for lunch.
AMY|and we'd be in class just the five hour time.
AMY|and that'd be better.
AMY|it's ridiculous having I'm sorry but as long as it's only a select group of people in this one math class.
AMY|it affects no other students.
MAR|they're not going to move it though.
AMY|they might.
AMY|if we bitch enough they might.
AMY|seriously, because it's only . the people that are really in ⁎our⁎ class.
MAR|yeah, but I don't think they're gonna change a class just . because . the students don't like it.
AMY|but it's still not fair that they are kicking us out of our class.
MAR|oh well no, but
AMY|I mean and the thing that really sucks is these are permit classes.
AMY|and the permit number should just be given out . you know?
AMY|and . it just I don't know.
MAR|did you guys xxx before them?
AMY|I was there on Friday asking about them and they're like we don't know anything about it, I'm like well I have the schedule book in ⁎my⁎ hand why don't you know anything about it, uhwuhwuhwuh, and I'm just like get a life.
AMY|they sent me to four different offices on Friday.
AMY|I was traipsing all over Graham, to all the different department offices going oh no that's LEFE, and I'm just well I was just there, oh no, it's not us it's LEFE.
AMY|and I called records and registration.
AMY|and the woman at records and registration called and yelled at the department chair's secretary because ⁎they⁎ didn't have the permits out and ⁎they⁎ didn't know what the hell was going on, they're just like well the person is not here today, that's no excuse, these schedule books were said they were coming out and they should've been on top of it.
AMY|and I mean the lady at Records and Reg great, I'm just like go, go, go, go.
AMY|you know?
AMY|, I'm like this is somebody that is higher than you and they're yelling at them It's just wonderful, It's not just this petty little student.
AMY|you know, I'm like this sucks, so they're like check back Monday.
AMY|and David checked on Monday and they weren't available and they weren't ready.
AMY|so he they went this morning.
AMY|and it's just the same, David is like David and Ross we're second on the list, second and third for this class.
MAR|mhm.
AMY|and . it's not fair.
MAR|and you can't get the ten.
AMY|and they they ⁎had⁎ the ten o'clock section.
MAR|David and Ross had the ten o'clock?
AMY|yeah.
AMY|and the Chi Dev professor's calling them telling them that they had to be switched to the other because . of the English and History.
AMY|and there are more than twenty five English and History.
MAR|So what are they gonna do with them?
AMY|give put Ross and David in the one o_clock class.
MAR|but xxx saying that there are more than twenty five students in English and History.
AMY|yeah, I know.
AMY|there might be more than twenty five in History and English.
AMY|and therefore we cannot . do this, and I'm like this class is required.
AMY|we're told by our major colleges to ⁎wait ⁎to take . excuse me this stupid class and to wait before we students teach.
AMY|because it's a perfect time.
AMY|it's a six weeks class, it's perfect.
AMY|not only that.
AMY|the class goes till March ninth and we're supposed to be student teaching February twenty sixth . I mean something is wrong.
AMY|⁎and⁎ I can't get my student teaching permit.
AMY|because the department hasn't approved it yet.
AMY|so my class schedule is just gonna be full.
AMY|like these bullshit hundred level classes.
AMY|just to have credit hours.
AMY|so that my financial aid doesn't get cancelled until I . get my student teaching figured out.
MAR|how many credit hours is student teaching?
AMY|xxx it can be up to twelve.
MAR|how many is yours?
AMY|zip right now.
MAR|no but I mean nobody
AMY|seven, it will be seven.
AMY|but . mine will be ten.
AMY|because I'm gonna ask for three extra credit hours um so that I have extra hours, I only need one
MAR|yeah.
AMY|but why do you think you're gonna get it?
AMY|oh because they have a class built in that will make it up to five extra credit hours that will make it up to twelve credit hours.
MAR|oh.
AMY|for people that don't have to any classes to take and just . have to student teach.
AMY|so that they are like full time students.
AMY|so that they can get financial aid.
MAR|yeah.
AMY|they have it so they you can get like the health insurance.
AMY|you can live in the residence house.
AMY|all that kind of stuff.
AMY|they have it built in.
AMY|so that student teaching is worth seven but if you need extra it can be worth xxx.
MAR|okay.
AMY|It's another class.
AMY|they just call it xxx.
AMY|so it's really nice of them.
AMY|I mean seriously.
AMY|cause otherwise I would have to pick another screwy gym class this semester.
AMY|because . what they're doing is they are offsetting the fact that you can't take any other classes when you student teach.
AMY|cause you can't.
AMY|I mean if I was student teaching like in Yorkville and the class didn't get out till four school didn't get out till four.
AMY|I'd have to stay to four thirty or whatever.
AMY|you wouldn't get back here any dinner until in time for the night class, really.
AMY|and there is such a limited number of classes offered at night?
MAR|yeah.
AMY|you know that are not necessarily be the classes you needed.
MAR|you know what I have done with my schedule?
MAR|my earliest class is at two on like Tuesday Thursday.

MAR|um.
AMY|that's not that much of a rush though.
AMY|you have an hour.
MAR|no no but I don't like I don't like . doing that.
MAR|I . had enough with that . this year.
