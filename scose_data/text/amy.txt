ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|then head back to Chicago in the morning.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|so . I said hey.
BRI|I'd rather do this and ride the bus home.
BRI|you know.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|because I mean oh.
BRI|it was awfull coming out, because uhm
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|I c.
ADD|what what day did you come back?
BRI|I came on Wednesday night.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|oh.
BRI|I tried something different this time.
ADD|uh huh.
BRI|I took the Ben Gelder bus
ADD|uhhuh
BRI|that goes from all here to Freeport.
ADD|oh.
BRI|and they picked me up at Freeport.
ADD|oh.
BRI|because the the Greyhound times are so screwy
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|it's like seven thirty in the morning or two thirty.
ADD|oh.
BRI|and after that there's nothing until the next day.
ADD|oh yeah.
BRI|and I had class.
BRI|so I couldn't make that bus.
ADD|ah ha.
BRI|so uhm so you know . I went out to O'Hare.
BRI|it took me I mean I don't think it saved any time at all, we thought
ADD|no.
BRI|it would be quicker almost.
BRI|even even coming to Freeport you know.
ADD|oh yeah.
BRI|because that Greyhound takes like five to five and a half hours, which is
ADD|oh.
BRI|ridiculous.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|I mean how far is Freeport from Chicago.
BRI|it's three and a half hours.
ADD|it is
BRI|about three and a half.
BRI|and like there has to be a better way.
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|so . you know I did that.
ADD|it took me an hour to get out to O'Hare.
ADD|oh jeez.
BRI|and then I was standing on the aisle for an hour because it's packed.
ADD|oh no.
BRI|and
ADD|oh God.
BRI|then ok.
BRI|we left on time.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|but the traffic down in the city was awful.
ADD|oh.
BRI|we we were an hour late.
BRI|so that the bus took three hours.
BRI|that's four.
ADD|oh.
BRI|and it took like an hour and a half to get back to Freeport.
ADD|Freeport.
ADD|so it was just like the same time.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|oh jeez.
ADD|that's not too good.
BRI|no.
BRI|that's why that's the rea only reason why I hate coming home is taking the bus.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|it's the biggest drag.
ADD|I know.
ADD|if you could just be home.
ADD|you know?
BRI|mhm mhm, if I had a car
ADD|if you had a car.
BRI|I mean when in the city
ADD|I know.
BRI|I don't want a car because it's a hassle I don't
ADD| oh yeah
BRI|want to put up with.
BRI|but for coming home.
ADD|whenever you want to come home.
BRI|I would love it.
ADD|I know.
ADD|that's like me.
ADD|next year I want to get an apartment, so
BRI|ah ha.
ADD|and uhm that because then one of the big things will be I wont have to spend all the time here only because it's break.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|you know I can come
BRI|yeah.
ADD|whenever I want to, but still I'll have to go by whoever is coming and going or
BRI|right.
ADD|have my friends come and get me.
ADD|you know.
ADD|that's bad.
BRI|yeah, it would be nice I mean it would be
ADD|yeah.
BRI|you would have . more use of it.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|the apartment and all.
ADD|the apartment.
ADD|especially then I could go . grocery shopping and stuff.
BRI|because you mean you your town is kind of spead out
ADD|my
BRI|like that?
ADD|yeah.
BRI|and you know Chicago's public transportation like
ADD|yeah.
BRI|crazy.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|so.
ADD|oh.
ADD|we have the busses still.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|but still.
ADD|it'd be a convenience.
BRI|uhhuh.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|I'll have to do it that way because I can't afford it.
BRI|well no.
ADD|I mean just take I'm gonna uhm you know pay for my own apartment and stuff.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|so just
BRI|that's enough.
ADD|just doing that.
ADD|and food and stuff's going to be hard.
BRI|right.
ADD|I decided this time . next year no more dorm stuff.
BRI|yeah.
BRI|same with me.
ADD|I can't stand it.
BRI|I know.
ADD|uh.
BRI|going back.
ADD|it's not bad.
ADD|Naomi and I get along well.
ADD|and so . but I just . had enough.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|the other day somebody uhm the other day Christy gets up really early, to
BRI|what for?
ADD|to get ready for school.
ADD|she has eight o'clock classes every day.
BRI|oh.
BRI|yuck.
ADD|every day.
ADD|and it doesn't really like seem to bother her.
ADD|but she gets up at like six fifteen so she can pre pair.
BRI|do herself up.
BRI|he he.
ADD|herself.
ADD|like a freshman.
ADD|but anyway . that's what she does.
ADD|and so uhm the other day she got up at six fifteen to do this stuff opened the door and like five hundred cans fell everywhere because cans have been plastered in front of our door.
BRI|no way.
ADD|yes.
BRI|oh.
ADD|and I don't know . it's like this one guy
ADD|who doesn't really have any friends on the floor anyway.
ADD|he's kind of a jerk.
ADD|and we're pretty sure that's who did it.
ADD|and uhm 'cause we don't think anybody could do that.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|you know.
ADD|it's sounds like something like nobody else would do it to us.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|and so
BRI|oh.
ADD|tin cans everywhere.
ADD|you know.
ADD|sort of hillarious if it happens to someone else you know ha ha ha.
BRI|yeah ha ha ha.
ADD|it's not too great if it happens to you.
BRI|if it happens to you.
ADD|and I was sound asleep.
ADD|I don't have any classes at that early.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|I mean like
BRI|oh God.
ADD|that was horrible.
ADD|I was really pissed off, but uhm that's I don't know just little things like that are
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|starting to bother me.
BRI|I know, it's
ADD|you know.
BRI|that novelty is just worn off.
BRI|you know.
ADD|it is.
ADD|and I'm just looking foreward to living with people who are older.
BRI|yes sure.
ADD|you know.
ADD|and in the dorms every year more freshmen more freshmen.
ADD|and I'm going oh God.
ADD|I can't stand these freshmen anymore.
BRI|I know.
ADD|I know.
ADD|and I'm not even that old.
ADD|but I just don't like to put up with that like.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|next year I'm twenty, and
BRI|you'd better be about it.
ADD|that'll be plenty.
BRI|oh yeah.
ADD|oh yeah.
ADD|so . there's this guy Tom Hopkins who uhm who's a friend of mine.
BRI|uh huh.
ADD|yeah.
ADD|he's living in a in a house, but uhm this guy this uhm landlord in DeKalb owns like twenty of these houses or something
BRI|oh really?
ADD|and he rents out rooms to kids.
BRI|uh huh.
ADD|I don't know it's like eight hundred dollars for the semester.
BRI|oh that's good.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|oh my God!
BRI|that makes me sick.
ADD|well they're all run down and beat up places.
ADD|but uhm.
BRI|but still.
ADD|I think that's what it is.
ADD|I think that's what Tom said he pays.
ADD|for the semester.
ADD|and so I'm he lives there now . and he's planning to be there over the summer probably.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|so I'm gonna live there over the summer.
ADD|and then from there we might I might even live there next year or else go and get another apartment next year.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|so because Tom said he might he'd also like a town house.
ADD|they're pretty cool.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|it's like it . has upstairs and downstairs and a couple of bedrooms
BRI|oh nice.
ADD|and bathrooms.
ADD|uhm so a bunch of us might do that.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|like get a couple of other people together and do that.
ADD|that would be cool.
BRI|yeah.
BRI|that would be nice.
ADD|these are all gonna be my friends that are my age or older.
BRI|year ha ha ha.
ADD|I think you know I just you know would like to live in the same area.
ADD|so I think that would be cool.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|I'm ready for that kind of stuff.
BRI|oh I know
ADD|you know I know food preparation's gonna be kind of . aggravating.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|that you know.
BRI|I think you get used to it though.
ADD|I think so.
BRI|you know.
ADD|I think so.
ADD|Mum's like you're gonna miss that you know.
BRI|yeah well .
ADD|but that's Mum for you you know.
BRI|that's Mum.
ADD|she only thinks things like that.
BRI|oh yeah.
BRI|of course.
ADD|she doesn't think of the other things.
ADD|you know?
BRI|of course.
ADD|but it's not gonna be up to her.
ADD|they're still gonna pay for my tuition.
ADD|plus . you know.
ADD|so wh where can you move to?
BRI|well . you see . I don't even know where I'm living next year.
ADD|yeah . that's the thing.
ADD|so you're not worrying about that.
BRI|I'm still deciding.
BRI|but I mean if I am in Chicago I'm definitely . not staying in a dorm.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|if I if I go to DeKalb actually, they I have several people
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|whom I could get who . will be looking or are looking for an apartment.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|that I could get easily get one with, in fact we've kind of looked just
ADD|just for the hell of it?
BRI|yeah.
BRI|just for the did I tell you about that?
ADD|no.
BRI|going looking for apartments?
ADD|no!
BRI|we did.
BRI|because you know . we were really into it and we knew we weren't getting get one till for a while a long while anyway.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|but it took something to keep us.
BRI|so you know?
ADD|uhhuh.
ADD|oh that's cool.
BRI|a friend of mine . Anne uhm she lives at home . now
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|and she is really aggravated you know
ADD|ha ha.
BRI|cause . you can imagine, she
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|she's lived in Chicago all her live.
BRI|and she wants an apartment, and uhm
ADD|yeah.
BRI|so ha like one week . there was one day.
BRI|it was really weird.
BRI|we were in the weirdest mood.
BRI|it was raining all day.
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|and we were just looking through . the newspaper at apartments.
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|and we were like let's go and look at some.
BRI|and we made these appointments, and
ADD|uhhuh
BRI|we went went all over the place and looked at several places
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|we had appointments for.
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|it was fun.
ADD|oh that's cool.
BRI|you know.
BRI|just to get some ideas of what the prices were.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|what we were looking at.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|and that kind of thing.
ADD|oh that's really neat.
BRI|so we figure that the only way we can afford it is like . if we rent a studio together.
ADD|oh well.
BRI|which is pretty small but still bigger than a dorm room you know?
ADD|uhhuh.
ADD|and you have your own bathroom.
BRI|mhm mhm.
BRI|and kitchen you know.
ADD|and kitchen and stuff.
ADD|oh wow.
BRI|so
ADD|it's a lot isn't it?
BRI|yeah.
ADD|I know.
ADD|especially in Chicago it's gotta be bad.
BRI|apartments are awful, I mean they
ADD|yeah.
BRI|studios are I mean a good deal in a studio is like four seventy five a month.
ADD|oh wow.
BRI|that that's cheap.
BRI|that's a cheap place.
ADD|oh man.
BRI|you know, and upwards from there I mean a around our area uhm an apartment like a one bedroom or something like that
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|goes for seven or eight hundred.
ADD|oh my God.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|oh wow.
BRI|I know.
BRI|it's crazy.
ADD|oh.
BRI|we found this place though.
BRI|uhm we just found this about a week ago.
BRI|and . it's really close by.
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|practically on campus.
ADD|oh yeah.
BRI|and it's . five twenty five
ADD|uh huh.
BRI| including heat.
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|it's we haven't seen it but it's supposed to be a large studio.
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|with uhm hard wood floors and
ADD|oh.
BRI|high ceilings and a fire place.
ADD|oh wow.
BRI|and we went oh yeah.
ADD|cool.
BRI|so it would still be like two something a month.
ADD|uh huh.
BRI|for each of us.
BRI|which is ok.
BRI|that's ok.
ADD|does that include everything?
BRI|it includes heat and uhm I think
ADD|water?
BRI|water.
BRI|but not electricity.
ADD|oh jeez.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|yeah.
ADD|yeah.
ADD|heat's a lot though so that's good.
BRI|oh yeah.
BRI|so that's a biggie when that's included.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|you know that's good.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|so.
ADD|wow.
BRI|I don't know.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|and you know things for a while things were going so bad that I actually I was thinking about moving out . after this quarter.
ADD|oh yeah
BRI|if I could even possibly swing it I really wanted to get out
ADD|oh yeah.
BRI|because it was just
ADD|oh yeah your room mate and you are not getting on and stuff.
BRI|mhm mhm.
BRI|things are better now, I mean
ADD|yeah.
BRI|I don't know.
BRI|I can handle it you know?
ADD|yeah.
BRI|it's not that bad but
ADD|you can make it through the year?
BRI|yeah I think so.
ADD|can you get out of your contracts anyway?
BRI|uhm . I talked to a couple of different people who have done it
ADD|oh.
BRI|and they said it was easy for them.
BRI|they just said that it was for financial reasons that they couldn't stay.
ADD|oh yeah.
BRI|uhm . they just faked it that easily
ADD|ha, that's I don't know how uh in Northern they say . that the only way you can get out of it is if you withdraw from the university
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|but I don't know.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|if it's really that tough and that.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|I don't know.
ADD|ha jeez.
BRI|yeah that's life
ADD|I know it's especially two people living in one room that's tough.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|that's really tough.
ADD|yeah.
ADD|maybe y you could always switch room mates maybe if you wanted?
BRI|yeah that that's true but
ADD|yeah, . it's hard to do too
BRI|mhm mhm.
BRI|so much tension you don't want that.
ADD|I know you don't want to go through with this.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|I might as well just put up with it you know?
ADD|I know.
BRI|try to just
ADD|yeah.
BRI|ignore how you feel or something.
ADD|yeah.
ADD|I know.
ADD|I know.
ADD|because it's very hard to do.
ADD|getting on with a person you don't like.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|but things have been a lot better ever since came home that week end.
ADD|that's good.
BRI|things have been so much better
ADD|oh that's good.
BRI|what with the tension.
ADD|xxx.
BRI|it it it's really I mean . it's not just her you know that was making me so
ADD|yeah.
BRI|tense and stuff, it's just every
ADD|yeah.
BRI|thing about this year that I've been so tense about
ADD|yeah.
BRI|it's just that
ADD|yeah.
BRI|was dissolving more.
ADD|now this was not helping.
ADD|you needed your privacy so you got through this stuff.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|exactly.
ADD|I understand.
ADD|yeah.
ADD|the lea the last thing you want is some other . girl in the room when.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|you're upset.
ADD|you know it's like leave me alone.
BRI|rrgh.
ADD|yeah.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|maybe that cleared up that tension so that I.
ADD|maybe.
ADD|Brianne can deal with that better.
ADD|something like that.
ADD|something.
BRI|something happened.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|things are better.
ADD|that's good.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|that's good.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|so in my spare time I go to the library and research colleges.
ADD|oh yeah!
BRI|to keep me happy.
ADD|yeah oh jeez.
ADD|what else what else are you thinking of doing?
BRI|I I
ADD|you don't know.
BRI|I don't know.
ADD|you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
BRI|my my my big thing right now is . uhm . University of Colorado.
ADD|oh wow.
BRI|because . in a way I kind of decided that you know for a while my big debate like should I go to art school
ADD|oh yeah.
BRI|or should I stay in a university?
ADD|right.
BRI|and in a way I kind of decided that it would be a bad option for me to go to art school.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|after this year.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|because I think I I need that university type of
ADD|yeah.
BRI|setting.
BRI|I need those liberal arts courses . you know?
ADD|uhhuh uhhuh.
BRI|I just think it's good.
BRI|it's a good background.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|and . in a way I feel
ADD|that's true.
BRI|like I'm . cheating myself, not that but like that I'm not getting the best I haven't fi
ADD|yeah.
BRI|I want a quality education
ADD|yeah.
BRI|you know?
ADD|oh yeah.
BRI|and uhm
ADD|yeah.
BRI|I just don't think that would that an art school would be
ADD|yeah.
BRI|the greatest for that.
ADD|yeah so what are your options for that?
ADD|you go through four years of regular school and then to art school or what?
BRI|that or else I transfer to a university that has a stronger art department.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|where I can like
ADD|yeah.
BRI|you know that even offers a masters
ADD|still major in art . but.
BRI|in studio.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|that would be great.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|you know?
ADD|you just stay.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|add it that long.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|take part for five or six years.
ADD|that's all.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|a five or six years program which you . wouldn't wouldn't have to go through all that.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|so
ADD|yeah.
BRI|and then you know I you know I've had this thing with Colorado forever
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|just take the whole atmosphere.
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|like that I'd really would like to . have out there.
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|and uhm . this is there's this American folder.
BRI|and I guess everything I've read about it sounds good, everything
ADD|yeah.
BRI|about it meets like you know you have Christmas qualifications
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|for school.
ADD|sure.
BRI|that you look for.
BRI|I mean all the ones that are . at the top of my list.
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|it has it.
BRI|I'm like wow.
ADD|wow.
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|it's like neat.
BRI|and they have a really good art program supposedly, I mean I've just send
ADD|yeah.
BRI|for information, from what I've read about it
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|they do.
ADD|they do.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|so that's good.
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|so I don't know
ADD|do you know anyone that goes there?
BRI|no.
ADD|or anyone who.
BRI|I don't
ADD|knows anyone who goes there?
BRI|no.
ADD|yeah.
ADD|that's the trouble.
ADD|because they can always give you an opinion on things.
BRI|uhhuh.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|mhm.
BRI|so . I don't know you know I'm still just kind of waiting and see what happens
ADD|yeah.
BRI|and everything you know.
ADD|just try to . take it easy and
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|be patient.
ADD|yeah.
ADD|because you probably got some time too.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|plenty of time till the twenty seventh.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|the only thing is money of course, and I mean
ADD| I know.
BRI|yeah I can decide these things but then what's gonna I mean you know the financial end if it
ADD|I know.
ADD|that's true.
BRI|I need to find a really good job that summer.
ADD|yeah.
ADD|so that you can work from day one till the end.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|I know.
ADD|but you can always go out that direction.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|you know.
ADD|like Mary did last year.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|the thing is I mean normally when you're not working at home then you've got to pay room and board.
BRI|I know.
BRI|I know.
ADD|you know.
ADD|that's bad.
ADD|that's the only . reason.
ADD|I mean I suppose it's worth it, I mean I suppose I can be worth it if
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|you find the right job.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|but I mean some of those jobs aren't any better than the jobs you could get here.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|you know especially if you started . here early, or
BRI|yeah.
ADD|if you came home a few weekends in like in March or something.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|there's probably good jobs to be found like in . offices and stuff
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|I don't know.
ADD|in law offices probably once in a while they'll have something.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|maybe better than you know
BRI|I know.
ADD|pool jobs.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|maybe you could find a better job than that.
BRI|yeah if I could find something good I guess I could come back, but
ADD|yeah.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|you know?
ADD|you know there's a possibility.
ADD|because you've had a lot of experience now.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|they hire people at the Chamber of Commerce too
BRI|really?
ADD|I mean . they hire like college a college intern type person you know.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|for envelope stuffing addressing and all those kind of things.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|all that office kind of stuff
BRI|right.
ADD|but when I went down there and they'd already take done that xxx but that was you know . end of May.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|they do it probably in March.
ADD|I don't know.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|I know it's not the not the thing you'd like to do though.
ADD|I'm gonna look for a job in DeKalb.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|so I I mean if you if you came up . and if you did something like that in your college time then you'd get rooms fairly cheap over the summer.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|that's the only thing you can do.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|because I'm planning because I'll be out like middle of May again.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|I'll be out from the middle of May till like uhm let me look . till like the twentieth or so of August or so.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|twenty fifth of August.
ADD|so I've all that time to work.
ADD|so I'm not going to come home . you know.
ADD|unless I come at the weekend.
BRI| one weekend.

BRI|oh god!
BRI|that makes me sick.
ADD|yeah.
ADD|but that's the way its just a room.
BRI|uh.
ADD|you know, it's just a bed room and then we share the kitchen and the . bath room
BRI|yeah.
ADD|and thing like that, it's just like ho just like living here in

ADD|hopefully . twenty or thirty hours a week I hope.
BRI|mhm yeah.
ADD|so I don't know where.
ADD|I mean it could be I've got two choices you know.
ADD|I could work at like Wendy's for the whole summer.
ADD|yeah and then quit.
ADD|make it my summer job or I can look for an on campus job.
BRI|uh huh.
ADD|you know.
ADD|which would then I would maybe cut it back and work all through next year.

ADD|and I would not want her to come back.
BRI|right.
ADD|especially not before her next scheduled time.
ADD|I'd want her to decide.
ADD|you know?
ADD|I mean I wouldn't want her hanging around my food if she's sick.

ADD|oh no.
BRI|they're more women, they're actually more women and they're kind of bitchy people
BRI|and they're really tough.

ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|so you it's like you had to study and you know
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|if you didn't you'd do very bad
ADD|yeah.
BRI|in these quizzes, but . you know as far as homework he really did
ADD|he he.
BRI|it would just be like a look over these pages
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|and then we'd go over it in class.
ADD|uhhuh.
ADD|that's cool.
ADD|that's cool.
BRI|you know it's like you can really see how another teacher can make it really hard
BRI|giving lots of assignments in that book and stuff.

ADD|so I have one more semester left.
BRI|mhm mhm.

ADD|and also being involved in the election.
ADD|and what else . my first year in an apartment.
BRI|mhm mhm.

BRI|yeah.

ADD|I wouldn't be able to go anywhere else.
ADD|but . I don't know.
ADD|well I suppose I could go somewhere else as long as it was a a foreign study thing.

BRI|yeah.
ADD|study abroad or something.
ADD|but I don't know.
ADD|if I can afford it or if I want to do that then.
BRI|uhhuh.
ADD|but . it would have to be something for credit because I want to . graduate on time.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|and I'm thinking maybe in my spring semester in my senior year there's gonna be twelve also.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|so I'd have to go both summers.

BRI|yeah I hope two.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|the other two I'm kind of . not counting on
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|in a way are
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|but uhm philosophy and
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|Spanish I hope.
BRI|it would be sad if I didn't make really.

BRI|it's my major I mean.
BRI|in a way though.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|we have to take all these uhm we have to take the basic studio, so I mean what's

ADD|like Frank's an art major and he doesn't like taking those classes.
BRI|I mean I had to take drawing of course.
BRI|I don't draw.

BRI|but but . you know I it's not what I want to do.
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|and it's I
ADD|yeah.
BRI|really feel more like xxx in a way.
ADD|yeah.

ADD|it's in the long run I'll be glad that I had a little more experience with a few different guys you know.
BRI|mhm mhm.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|in the long run I'll be all right you know look back at at all the friend good friends I've made and you know and say well I did it
BRI|yeah.
ADD|you know?
ADD|and not just say have dated this guy for so long you know.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|so . it's not always easy and you do get attached kind of fast sometimes.
BRI|oh I know.
ADD|you know?
BRI|it's easy.
ADD|easy to get attached.
ADD|but you know . you take a little hurt and I mean you learn from it.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|yeah in a way.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|he he it can it's dating it can be it can be fun though.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|well like I have not seen anybody at all the year.
ADD|no?
BRI|no.
BRI|I don't know I think it's that I don't want to.
ADD|yeah.
ADD|yeah.
ADD|yeah.
ADD|you know sometimes you'd just rather not.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|I mean . in a way I think I do.
ADD|but then again.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|I'm not making any effort.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|at all, I mean
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|I have I haven't got out of my way at all to even try to be friendly with people
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|or try to meet people.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|so.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|it's just something
ADD|yeah.
ADD|mhm mhm I know.
BRI|yeah.
BRI|I mean for a while there was like this thing I don't know well . he he's like our mutual friend Peter ok?
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|and then that was why.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|he's our mutual friend of all of our friends you know?
ADD|aha.
BRI|I just didn't I don't know . for a while uhm I kind of was starting to you know
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|maybe think that something was gonna happen or that you know I kind of liked him.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|because you know, we're just we're always together we're always with him and stuff like that and
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|he's a nice guy
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|you know?
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|but . then I I just had to stop myself because I I just didn't even want to deal with it because . things it was so stupid in a way.
BRI|because I don't know if it was more like because just well he was there.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|or if I really would have picked him out necessarily.
ADD|mhm mhm.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|but uhm because there had been something going on, nothing like they weren't going out or anything but I mean
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|you know . some sparks between him and Christina.
ADD|oh yeah.
BRI|like a few months ago.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|and then I'm like no, I don't want to deal with that either.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|you know I mean Christina has a boyfriend of course.
BRI|you know.
ADD|oh yeah.
BRI|but uhm she kind of had a crush on Peter.
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|and I didn't want to get into it.
BRI|so I just kind of like . told myself to shut up.
ADD|auh.
BRI|like don't even think about it . don't even.
ADD|oh yeah.
BRI|because you know I just I don't
ADD|yeah.
BRI|think it would work anyway.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|in that situation.
BRI|you know?
ADD|that's fairly prob yeah.
BRI|so it didn't work out either.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|like you know.
BRI|we still hang out sometimes.
ADD|that's good.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|see this is one of those things, you just get it . comes over you and then it goes back and
ADD|oh.
BRI|you just forget that it ever happened, you know?
ADD| I know.
ADD|I know.
ADD|it happens.
ADD|yeah, it happened to me.
ADD|this year with uhm a different guy, uhm my friend Tom has a and I uhm well Tom's friend Chris
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|is uhm a pretty cool guy.
ADD|and . I sort of fell for him.
BRI|aha.
ADD|ear earlier.
ADD|and uhm you know we had a little something started.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|and then after that
BRI|I know.
BRI|hi hi it's so funny.
ADD|and then that . he just it was like he didn't want to and I was like well . you know, I I still wanted to go out with him
BRI|yes.
ADD|but he did he didn't seem to show any indication
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|that he wanted too.
ADD|so then I got then I just gave up.
BRI|right.
ADD|huh huh I don't know if it's over yet.
BRI|oh huh huh.
ADD|but I I guess it is.
ADD|I mean I I could probably be persuaded.
BRI|right.
ADD|you know.
ADD|if he wanted to go out with me I would figure you know I would be happy.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|I'd probably go out with him, but . if
BRI|sure.
ADD|he doesn't then I don't think that's the way to go.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|because you know I mean I can't force it.
BRI|uhm the thing that makes me mad is that you know I mean I . if we went out it wouldn't be like as serious.
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|it would be I think . we would be like really good friends.
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|but you know . not like well . we're gonna get engaged
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|or something like that you know?
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|just sort of seeing each other you know?
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|but uhm
ADD|that's ok.
BRI|it kind of makes me mad.
BRI|because he's all of our friends and things.
ADD|oh yeah.
BRI|because I know that if he wasn't like if he was just my friend
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|say.
BRI|I no I would go I'd be going out with him.
ADD|yeah, that's kind of bad.
ADD|aggravating.
BRI|but because it's nothing that that's so intense
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|or deep.
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|it's not worth . messing with.
ADD|oh yeah.
BRI|do you know what I mean?
ADD|yeah, kind of.
BRI|if it was just me.
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|there would be nothing to
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|worry about messing up.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|because well we'd go out whatever.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|but since . like he's friends with my friends
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|and my friends are his friends
ADD|yeah.
BRI|and all this.
ADD|if everything got . complicated
BRI|yeah.
ADD|then.
BRI|I know there's a trouble there because girls and boys can get close can be . friends.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|and then if there's something more in the . middle of it
BRI|yeah.
ADD|then are you still friends with all those same people if it doesn't work out?
BRI|yeah, exactly.
BRI|exactly.
ADD|or if it hurts somebody else?
ADD|yeah, I know.
BRI|and you know
ADD|I know.
BRI|he's close to Christina.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|you know what I mean.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|but the problem is
ADD|you live with her.
BRI|I live yeah.
BRI|I live with her.
ADD|I know.
BRI|if we have problems what if he he you know
ADD|yeah.
BRI|they're are good friends.
BRI|what if he wants to talk to her about it?
ADD|right.
BRI|you know?
ADD|you don't want to hear about that
BRI|yeah.
ADD|right?
BRI|yeah.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|you know.
BRI|it and I I because I've kind of been through this before.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|and I don't like those kinds of things.
BRI|but I mean I'm the type of person that wants to keep my boyfriend and my friends separate.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|I because I just can't handle it.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|you know?
ADD|yeah.
BRI|so before even trying I was like uhm just don't.
ADD|yeah.
ADD|but you could be persuaded too.
BRI|I oh yeah!
BRI|yeah.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|I could be.
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|yeah.
BRI|I think I'm more content now.
BRI|first when I first started going out with people other people I was more impatient.
BRI|I was like come on this has got to develop.
BRI|yeah.
BRI|ha ha.
ADD|you know.
ADD|develop something.
BRI|right.
ADD|and then now I think I'm a little bit more patient but you know.
ADD|well . just stay.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|be calm.
ADD|doesn't matter, you have somebody to go out with, you do, you have to hang around some night, just hang around.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|just calm down.
BRI|that's cool.
BRI|that's cool.
ADD|so I'm trying to do that.
ADD|because I I mean I had a good relationship for a while and now I don't.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|so I have to go around from there.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|you know.
ADD|eventually I'll have one again.
BRI|I think so
ADD|but guys are great.
ADD|you know?
BRI|yeah.
ADD|I don't have anything against men, huh I mean I know some women who you know they get a little bit hurt
BRI|they'll xxx about it.
ADD|they get a little bit hurt.
ADD|and then all men are so awful, oh God.
ADD|oh God.
ADD|they're horrid, I never want to be with them again.
BRI|right.
ADD|you know?
ADD|and then they fall again.
ADD|and then hurt again.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|and then guys are so terrible.
BRI|xxx.
ADD|and they especially if they expect certain kinds of guys
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|and certain characteristics you know, and like
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|you know.
ADD|there are more differences between . women than there are between . just women and men, I mean
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD| there's differences from any individuals.
BRI|oh yeah, you can't generalize.
ADD|you can't say men are and women are eh when women aren't all the same either.
BRI|right.
ADD|you know?
ADD|so.
ADD|I don't know where it'll go.
BRI|you know . I was still keeping my eye on Mike my ex you know.
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|hate him now.
ADD|oh yeah.
BRI|I just hate him.
ADD|yeah.
BRI|it was fun

BRI|I could go over . to him, you know I could stop by the store
ADD|uhhuh.
BRI|tonight.
BRI|you know?
ADD|yeah.
BRI|just knowing that
BRI|makes you feel like.
BRI|you know what I mean, not that I ever would have probably
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|in reality
ADD|no.
BRI|unless like I was really drunk or something like that.
BRI|but
ADD|mhm mhm.
BRI|you know.
BRI|something stuff like that.
ADD|mhm mhm.
ADD|mhm mhm, you'd better
BRI|I don't know.

ADD|I do this.

BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|but that requires planning like
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|you know, you gotta let somebody know that you want it and stuff.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|and I'm too lazy to do that, because I mean
BRI|oh yeah.
ADD|it's not exactly at the top of my priority list.
BRI|of course not.
ADD|so I was just like Mum as long as you're coming up why don't you bring a vacuum along and we'll do the rug?

BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|where she wants to give a certain image.
BRI|yeah.
ADD|and I it's not the kind
BRI|it's not.
ADD|of image that David would go for.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|because he would't understand it.
BRI|mhm mhm.
ADD|he'd never understand it.
ADD|so who knows , I was just like what ha ha I Mum told me about it like no way.

ADD|yeah, no.
ADD|I mean David is not too bright.
ADD|I don't know he's not, not that I don't I like him

ADD|I didn't mind chemistry too bad.
ADD|biology I kind of liked.
