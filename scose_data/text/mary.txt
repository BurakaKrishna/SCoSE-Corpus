MAR|I'm supposed to work for Professor Harrison grading tests and stuff over Thanksgiving.

PAT|mhm.
AMY|a couple of weeks ago, and . he was saying . how in her family one person talks.
AMY|and then they all think about it.
AMY|and then another person reacts.
AMY|and they think about it.
AMY|and then another person , he's like in my house, he says everybody just all talk at once.
PAT|well.
AMY|and he said it's really it's really interesting.
AMY|to see the differences.
AMY|in two styles of speaking between families.
PAT|that tape was something.
PAT|because all it was was a blur of voices.
PAT|and then . somebody would talk.
PAT|and everyone would listen.
PAT|and then . they would all go right back to talking at once.
PAT|and you couldn't understand ⁎anything⁎ on the tape.
PAT|all you can hear were all these ⁎voices⁎ going at once.
PAT|and I told the story about you and the little chipmunk out in the garage.
MAR|oh.
AMY|I kept I kept I was just thinking about that the other day.
AMY|that thing scared the heck out of me.
PAT|with all with all the it was twice.
AMY|it was twice, and the first time there's a rat in there, there's a big mouse in there, I saw it.
AMY|no, there's nothing in there, yes, I saw it.
MAR|I wouldn't believe her.
PAT|well I went out.
PAT|remember, and set the bag it was a bag of cans.
PAT|that was when we were looking for the golf ball, because you hit the ball in the can.
AMY|yeah and then you found its little cubby holes in a box or something.
PAT|well, what what
MAR|you found all the seeds, didn't you?
PAT|all the seeds.
RAL|all the seeds in a plastic bag.
PAT|right by the wood out there.
PAT|and when we moved the wood to clean it there was the whole thing.
PAT|it must have sat against the wood and then ate all the sunflowers.
RAL|all the sunflower seeds.
RAL|all the shells were in the bag.
PAT|there were shells everywhere.
AMY|yeah and you guys wouldn't believe me.
MAR|well I guess there was something there.
PAT|well I didn't the first time but the second time I did.
AMY|scared me both times.
AMY|and of course it happened to me.
AMY|you know, nobody else.
PAT|little sucker was living in the garage.
RAL|living it up and living high on the hog.
PAT|had it made.
PAT|he was in out of the cold and he had something to eat.
PAT|and, and by the way, we have to get a bird feeder.
PAT|I'll have to talk to ma and go to that audubon place.
PAT|I don't think we're gonna hang up the bird feeder any more.
PAT|the squirrels the squirrel eats it all.
AMY|oh at least somebody makes good use of it.
MAR|can't you get a bird feeder that the squirrel can't get at?
RAL|well not that you can hang that on a tree.
RAL|xxx.
PAT|what?
RAL|that's not where you where you have it hanging on the tree.
RAL|where you can hang it from a tree.

MAR|doesn't she.
MAR|so that the squirrel.
RAL|xxx.
PAT|they have a squirrel guard.
RAL|piece of metal that comes like this , and ducks under it but
PAT|that's that.
AMY|oh.
PAT|it's a rare feeder.
PAT|that'll keep a squirrel off.
PAT|you know that squirrel.
PAT|I think it's the one with the broken tail.
PAT|your father saw a little dead animal down the street xxx.
PAT|that squirrel with that broken tail.
MAR|oh, the squirrel died?
RAL|I guess he ended up with a broken neck on top of a broken tail.
AMY|very funny, Dad
RAL|well I can't help it the poor thing died.
PAT|well, I know.
PAT|but they just don't have to make ⁎fun⁎ of it.
AMY|I should check the xxx.
PAT|and it died.
RAL|poor thing died.
RAL|really hit it.
PAT|they haven't been around for a long time.
PAT|and I asked xxx.
PAT|she hasn't seen the squirrel.
PAT|I guess, the one that Hal used to feed all the time.
AMY|what was that?
MAR|what was that?
RAL|sounds like Tootsy.
AMY|sounds like a siren.
MAR|sounds like a siren.
RAL|no.
AMY|then again police cars don't have sirens any more, do they?
RAL|they just don't use it as hoften as they used to.
AMY|we just saw one using one.
MAR|gottcha.
PAT|boy did we ever?
PAT|somebody was going out on a call.
AMY|on Monday night.
AMY|Monday night . he has his on.
RAL|speaking of Monday night.
RAL|your car tracks.
RAL|coming into the driveway Monday night?
RAL|when you parked the car?
RAL|Tuesday night?
RAL|. Tuesday night.
AMY|mhm.
RAL|you kind of missed the driveway a little bit.
RAL|you know where that hole is?
RAL|where everybody keeps hitting it with their tires?
AMY|oh . no that's when I backed out one night , I thought I
PAT|should have been that Monday night because I was with her.
AMY|yeah.
RAL|then it was Tuesday with that with the snow.
RAL|because with the snow that's how I found it.
MAR|Brad did the same thing last night , be said oh my God ooh oops.
RAL|maybe it was Brad then.
MAR|he says I think I missed.
AMY|no I I knew it wasn't me.
MAR|no.
MAR|I think, Brad did it last night.
AMY|because I uhm
MAR|this he said he said oh I I cut it too short.
MAR|but see he's so he's leery now.
MAR|I mean he drove really slow.
MAR|I've never seen Brad driving that slow.
RAL|I don't know.
PAT|xxx.
AMY|he's gonna be nervous
MAR|Brad does not drive fast.
MAR|he never has drove driven fast.
MAR|but he uhm . drove really slow coming home, and the roads were fine too but
MAR|he's just gonna be cautious for a long time.
PAT|mhm.
MAR|he won't take Plank too.
MAR|It's kind of funny because , I joked about at lunch time I said what if I said I didn't I didn't want you to take Plank home he's like . well, he's like you can say it, he says I'm the driver and I'm taking Plank.
PAT|ooh.
PAT|how awful.
PAT|oh god.
MAR|I said oh Brad, I said that was awfully bad the ⁎last⁎ time, and he said I'm still the driver, and he says and I don't think it's gonna be that bad, I'm taking Plank.
AMY|oh I bet you
AMY|stupid guy.
PAT|that conversation of uh.
AMY|don't mention it to him it will upset him.
AMY|don't mention it at all.
PAT|xxx I'm sure it will.
MAR|he uhm he said.
MAR|it really, you know.
MAR|we really didn't think it was that bad.
MAR|we were going all right.
MAR|and then we rounded that curve and . came out of the curve , and he said I've started to accelerate out of the curve , and . hit that ice
MAR|and he was in the other lane , and I thought he was gonna get control of it
MAR|and he I thought he was turning to go back into our lane.
RAL|mhm.
MAR|but he said he was still trying to keep control of the ⁎fish⁎tail.
MAR|so he obviously . overcorrected it.
MAR|like his father said , because of the uh
MAR|though he's got a lot of play in his wheel.
MAR|and . he said.
MAR|he probably just overcorrected it.
MAR|and that's what started our spin.
MAR|cause we spun this way
MAR|then all the way around.
AMY|you spun this way, okay.
AMY|he went to this lane and then you spun that way.
MAR|yeah.
AMY|and then hit
AMY|he just continued you know to do.
MAR|sideways.
RAL|spun all the way around?
RAL|three sixty?
MAR|yeap
AMY|and so
MAR|it's so weird because you don't have time to be scared.
PAT|no.
MAR|the ⁎only⁎ time that I felt any ⁎fear⁎ was when I saw the sign coming.
MAR|and I thought we are going to hit the sign.
MAR|and then . I watched another person hit the other sign on the other side of the road.
MAR|and that one I didn't even realize it smashed their wind their back window.
MAR|until . Jaimie had said something.
AMY|and there was somebody sitting there?
MAR|yeah.
MAR|there was somebody sitting, she's like well I ducked.
MAR|and then the reaction was really weird.
MAR|because they all got out of the car , and they're like what are you all all right, are you okay, oh yeah.
MAR|and they are sort of smiling and.
MAR|it was like they didn't actually realize.
MAR|what had happened you know
AMY|were they all college students or young kids or something?
MAR|well it was hard to tell because they were all dressed up.
MAR|it was three woman three women.
MAR|they were all dressed up.
AMY|three ⁎women⁎?
MAR|yeah.
AMY|well I thought they were just kids.
MAR|no, the other car was just kids.
MAR|the car that did it right after us.
MAR|were just kids.
AMY|oh I thought the one that hit the ⁎sign⁎.
AMY|and smashed the window were just kids.
MAR|they looked ⁎young⁎.
MAR|that they was it was three women though.
MAR|probably in their twenties.
PAT|well.
MAR|the other ones were college students though.
MAR|and I thought it was just a scream because.
PAT|you'd think they'd take better care of Plank Road.
MAR|I ran down there
MAR|and I asked them all if they were all right?
MAR|yeah, yeah.
MAR|they got out of the car.
MAR|they pushed the car out.
MAR|and left
MAR|and our car was in a ⁎ditch⁎.
MAR|you know?
MAR|and Brad triied Brad tried to push it out.
AMY|oh you couldn't push that out?
PAT|at least those kids would have at least said as long we are here , could we try and see if we could get you out of there?
AMY|wait now you mean the three women?
MAR|no.
RAL|the other.
PAT|the kids.
RAL|the kids.
MAR|the other kids.
MAR|the woman did it after the other car was gone already.
RAL|so how many cars spun out there, counting you.
MAR|three.
MAR|three while we were there, and Brad says that's the only thing I have in my defense that I wasn't driving too fast.
AMY|yeah that's probably the only thing that's keeping him.
MAR|because he does, he blames himself because
PAT|oh, it's so foolish to blame yourself and think about it afterwards.
PAT|it happened.
PAT|it's over.
MAR|and then he said he was coming over, he said
MAR|I can't get it out of my mind, he said I just keep playing it over and over and over in my mind, he said I can't get it out.
MAR|and he doesn't remember too much about it.
PAT|you never do, because it takes seconds for it to happen.
MAR|he I can he fought the car for a good ten, fifteen seconds before we lost total control.
PAT|well the only thing you can both say is thank God you're safe.
PAT|that's all.
AMY|did he hit the brakes at all?
MAR|no.
MAR|he didn't touch the brakes.
AMY|now see what
PAT|that's where I make my mistake.
AMY|see, I slid a couple times but I pumped the brakes.
AMY|that one time, I was coming down a hill.
AMY|and there was a car stopped at a red light.
AMY|and when I hit the brakes the first time, I slid.
AMY|and I was only less than a car length away from him, so I just started slamming them down.
AMY|and I stopped within inches of his bumper.
RAL|that doesn't do any good.
RAL|slamming them down isn't going to do you any good, you're going to
AMY|yeah but it was
RAL|it's going to throw you into another skid.
AMY|yeah, but it was pumping them and it got me stopped.
AMY|I mean, as long as I didn't hit him into the intersection.
PAT|they always tell you don't use your brake.
PAT|wasn't there any way to get around him?
AMY|no way!
AMY|I was less than a car length of way behind him.
AMY|if I even turned the wheel , there was a median and
AMY|if I had turned the wheel I would have hit my entire side into his bumper
MAR|oh well see that's what that car did when we were back there last night
MAR|to get the rest of the stuff out of the car.
MAR|I mean I I thought Brad and his father were goners
PAT|he was skidding around?
MAR|mh?
PAT|he was skidding?
MAR|no he
PAT|or the cars that were coming through?
MAR|the cars that were coming through.
MAR|and then that guy.
MAR|Came flying so fast in his little compact car.
MAR|he drove on the shoulder.
MAR|and he almost hit Brad's car
MAR|he went in between Brad's car . and the cars that were in the lane.
PAT|well they try to tell you don't drive like that.
PAT|but there's always that young fellow that isn't going to pay any attention.
PAT|and he's gonna drive just the way he pleases.
AMY|so they were coming this way
MAR|who?
AMY|the other people?
AMY|the guy that was uhm.
MAR|no . they were going.
MAR|you know,.
MAR|Brad's car was sitting facing ⁎this⁎ way.
AMY|yeah, that's what I'm saying.
AMY|it was facing this.
MAR|and they were going ⁎this⁎ way.
MAR|and this car came and went like ⁎this⁎.
AMY|that's yeah.
AMY|that's what I'm saying.

AMY|on that one lane.
AMY|cause she's like people.
AMY|so I want the town to change it.
