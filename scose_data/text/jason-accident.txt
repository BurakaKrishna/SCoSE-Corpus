JAS|we've kept everything pretty much under control though this year.
DER|that's right you can't wrestle around or bad things will happen.
JAS|yeah, Roger got his nose.
DER|you know what happened to my one of my aunt's friends out in Iowa?
DER|like when when she was younger, she had a headgear from braces, and these two girls were wrestling around just playing around, wrestling.
DER|and one girl pulled her headgear off her mouth and let it snap back.
DER|and it slid up her face and stuck in her eyes and blinded her.
JAS|wow.
DER|isn't that horrid?
DER|that's horrid.
JAS|when my.
DER|blinded her for life.
DER|isn't that horrid.
DER|that's just I mean just from goofing around, just from screwing a little bit of screwing around.
DER|and if and another thing, it it it's terrible the things that can happen.
DER|that's why I don't like people screwing around with swords and trying to throw people in the showers and stuff like that, and everything like that.
JAS|you know what happened to my aunt Florence when she was a little girl?
DER|oh what happened.
JAS|she was like screwing around like around Christmas time?
JAS|and like she, I I guess this was like when they had candles on trees?
JAS|she lit her hair on fire.
DER|oh wow.
JAS|you met her.
DER|but did anything happen?
DER|she get a burned head or something?
JAS|uh I don't know, maybe you could shave her and look for scar tissue.
DER|oh I don't want to shave your aunt Florence's head.
DER|does your aunt Florence have like spinalbiffera or something like that?
JAS|I don't know.
