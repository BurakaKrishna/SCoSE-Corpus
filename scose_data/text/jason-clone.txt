DER|perhaps I'll do some rudimentary experiments on my own.
JAS|yeah, Mike, we could probably, you know, uh, get one of mike's hairbrushes and get started.
DER|isn't that uh, somehow you have to increase the metabolism rate to have it grow, what would, what would they
DER|that would automatically uh multiply the cell growth to the age of nineteen <unk>.
JAS|and then, we could then, we could then try it, though.
JAS|so it would be better than mike, you know, his personality we could kill mike off, and then we'd have a better roommate to live with.
JAS|and nobody'd ever know the difference.
DER|okay, yeah, let's see, what'd we want, what do we want to do to the new mike.
DER|okay.
DER|we don't <unk> that's so quite so arrogant.
JAS|quite so arrogant.
JAS|not quite so arrogant.
JAS|more subservient.
DER|yeah, ahuh yeah.
DER|he should have to give us more things too.
JAS|yeah, he's got a lot more things jammed in his room than I've got in here.
DER|he should um, perhaps, sleep out in the hallway more often.
JAS|you know, or, like you could probably blast out look, you could um, you could divide this room right in half, and blast out mike's wall, and then we could just have two rooms, two big rooms.
JAS|and mike could sleep in the hallway closet or something.
