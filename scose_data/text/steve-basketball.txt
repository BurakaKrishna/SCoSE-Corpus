CHA|some parents take it offensive though.
CHA|and and ah th like this past weekend this this one coach.
CHA|I called a flagrant foul.
CHA|on his fifth and sixth grade team.
CHA|three weekends ago.
WAY|flagrant
CHA|flagrant was okay, this was the situation.
CHA|there is a kid, dribbling down the court and he has a wide open lay up.
CHA|his his the kid on his team, was right behind him, okay?
WAY|uhhuh.
CHA|and my instinct when I'm an official I always say, let em go you know, lay off them so that they don't do something stupid you know hit them in the back and hurt them.
CHA|I always say just let em go.
WAY|you can talk to them during the game?
CHA|I just pull the whistle on them.
CHA|I just yell at them.
CHA|the official can say anything.
CHA|no one hears it except you know, the players.
CHA|I'm like let 'em go, let 'em go.
CHA|well this kid trips over his own two feet.
WAY|huh heh heh heh heh.
CHA|and as he's falling, he grabs onto the back of the player holding uh carrying the ball.
CHA|and he pulls down his jersey and pulls him down.
CHA|and I was like whoa, all right, I had a decision to make.
CHA|obviously it was it wasn't with the intent to hurt him, because he tripped.
CHA|but then again he did obstruct him from getting a wide open lay up.
CHA|so I ju I was like, well, you know, I called the flagrant, which is the arms crossed.
CHA|if you want to call a flagrent with aggression, with the intent to hurt, you have the arms crossed, then you've got to swing them down.
CHA|like really, really hard.
CHA|then you know it's like that was a really serious foul.
CHA|and that's a technical and you can get kicked out of the game for doing something like that.
WAY|mhm.
CHA|I just called the simple flagrant.
CHA|the coach went nuts, he went nuts.
CHA|so this past weekend I'm officiating this game.
WAY|uhhuh.
CHA|not not not even close to the same situation, I officiate the entire game, everything went so smoothly.
CHA|he didn't say two words to me other than, you know, he warned me about one of his players almost getting hurt, I'm like, whatever.
CHA|you know you just you blow it off.
CHA|you completely look through him, you say thank you sir, you know, I'll look into that, and you walk away.
CHA|well at the end of the game, he came up to me, and his exact words were I don't know if I should bleep this out or anything.
GEO|nuh.
CHA|the exact words were, he came he came up to me and said, you mother fucker.
CHA|you're holding a grudge from three weeks ago.
CHA|and I'm just sitting, you know, and I'm like, oh my god.
CHA|right?
CHA|and my first reaction was to say to him, you know, something very sarcastic about his mother?
CHA|considering he brought that into effect?
GEO|mhm.
WAY|huh huh huh.
CHA|but I thought, this guy paid money to be in this tournament.
CHA|and I said, sir, I'm in college, I can't remember three weeks ago, and I walked away.
WAY|huh huh huh huh.
CHA|that's what I said to him, and I walked away.
WAY|that's funny.
CHA|and he went straight to my coach.
CHA|and said this tournament's this and that and da da da da da.
CHA|yadda yadda yadda.
CHA|and my coach just laughed when he heard what I said?
WAY|huh huh huh huh.
CHA|Huh huh he just laughed, he came up to me, he was like, that was great.
CHA|huh huh huh I was like, well, you know.
CHA|that guy was such a jerk!
WAY|that's good!
CHA|oh I hate that guy.
