*CHA:	there is a kid, dribbling down the court and he has a wide open lay up. 13312_17491
*CHA:	his [/] his [/] the kid on his team, was right behind him, okay? 17491_23290
*WAY:	uhhuh. 23290_23802
*CHA:	and my instinct when I'm an official I always say, “let em go::” you know, lay off them so that they don't do something stupid you know: hit them in the back and hurt them. 23802_30224
*CHA:	I always say just let ⌈em go⌉. 30224_31232
*WAY:	                      ⌊you can talk⌋ to them during the game? 31232_32672
*CHA:	I just pull the whistle on them. 32672_34042
*CHA:	I just yell at them. 34042_34554
*CHA:	the official can say anything. 34554_35411
*CHA:	no one hears it except [/] you know, the players. 35411_36947

*CHA:	well this kid trips over his own two feet. 38483_41043
*WAY:	huh heh heh heh heh. 41043_42067
*CHA:	and as he's falling, he grabs onto the back of the player holding uh carrying the ball. 42067_49056
*CHA:	and he pulls down his jersey and pulls him down. 49056_51895
*CHA:	and I was like: “whoa:, all right”, I had a decision to make. 51895_55200
*CHA:	obviously it was [/] it wasn't with the intent to hurt him:, because he tripped. 55200_60237
*CHA:	but then again he did obstruct him from getting a wide open lay up. 60237_63654
*CHA:	so I ju [/] I was like, “well, you know”, I called the flagrant, which is the arms crossed. 63654_68083
*CHA:	if you want to call a flagrent with aggression, with the intent to hurt, you have the arms crossed, then you've got to swing them down. 68083_73382
*CHA:	like really, really hard. 73382_75596
*WAY:	&=sniffs . 75596_76025
